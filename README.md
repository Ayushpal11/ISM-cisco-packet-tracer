## Introduction

Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool to design, configure, and troubleshoot network setups. This repository includes a collection of Packet Tracer files that demonstrate key networking concepts such as:

- Tunneling
- DHCP Configuration
- Firewall Rules
- Port Forwarding
- Standard Access Lists
- AAA
- Signature-based IDS and IPS
- Zone-based firewall


## Features

- **Tunneling**: Learn how to configure and implement various tunnelling protocols such as GRE and IPsec, and understand their use cases in secure network communications.
- **DHCP Configuration**: Understand the setup and management of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for automatic IP address assignment and efficient network management.
- **Firewall Rules**: Explore the configuration of firewall rules to secure your network by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Port Forwarding**: Please look at examples of port forwarding to direct traffic to specific devices on your network, enabling external access to internal services.
- **Standard Access Lists**: Implement standard access control lists (ACLs) to filter network traffic and enhance security by specifying which devices or traffic types are allowed or denied.
- **AAA**: Configure Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) to manage user access and track user activity on the network, enhancing security and accountability.
- **Signature-based IDS and IPS**: Learn about Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) using signature-based methods to detect and prevent network threats.
- **Zone-based Firewall**: Set up zone-based firewalls to provide advanced traffic control and segmentation, enhancing the security and manageability of your network.
